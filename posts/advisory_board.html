                            <br> 22 June, 2020<br>
                            <br><br> Unitary Fund has grown quickly since its inception as a small microgrant program. We’ve now awarded more than 22 project grants across 14 countries and 4 continents, resulting in 6 publications, more than 11 open source
                            libraries, a venture funded startup, and several folks working full time in the field who got their start with a Unitary Fund grant. Open source projects supported by Unitary Fund have more than 31 contributors, 570 stars and
                            95 forks on github. All this has happened on just the $40k so far granted.
                            <br><br> We believe that these results speak for themselves, and we’re ready to grow them further. To help with this, <b>we have invited 15 members of the quantum technology
                                community to join
                                our volunteer advisory board.</b> Many of them have already been helping behind the scenes at Unitary Fund, reviewing applications and mentoring projects. The group also includes Ntwali and Michał, who themselves were some
                            of the first of our grant winners.
                            <br><br> They are all experts in their fields, and they bring experience across the quantum technology stack: various hardware, programming languages etc. They work at academic research centers, national labs, corporate research
                            divisions, and startups, both collaborating on large open source projects and having authored personal projects. Importantly, they all share our commitment to growing the community of open science and technology.
                            <br><br> The advisory board will help source and review grant applications, mentor projects, and provide technical advice on Unitary Fund’s research program.
                            <br><br> We are grateful for their help and are excited to bring them on board to recognize their contribution.
