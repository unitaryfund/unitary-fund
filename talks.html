                                    <p> The manipulation of neutral atoms by light is at the heart of countless scientific discoveries in the field of quantum physics in the last three decades. The level of control that has been achieved at the single particle
                                        level within arrays of optical traps, while preserving the fundamental properties of quantum matter (coherence, entanglement, superposition), makes these technologies prime candidates to implement disruptive computation
                                        paradigms. In this talk, I will present <a href="https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser">pulser</a>, a recently developed open-source python framework enabling practitioners to control those devices at the pulse level.</p>

                                        that, used by students, researchers, engineers, is having a tremendous impact on quantum science research. QuTiP is also Unitary Fund’s first affiliated project. In this talk, I will introduce the library and take
                                        the example of some new developments in QuTiP to show the ease with which one can simulate open quantum systems as well as contribute to the development of such open-source software tools to promote reproducibility
                                        and therefore accelerate the adoption of a particular simulation technique across the research community.</p>

                                    <p>We present <strong><a href="https://qcor.ornl.gov/">qcor</a></strong> - a language extension to C++ and compiler implementation that enables heterogeneous quantum-classical programming, compilation, and execution in
                                        a single-source context. Our work provides a first-of-its-kind C++ compiler enabling high-level quantum kernel (function) expression in a quantum-language agnostic manner, as well as a hardware-agnostic, retargetable
                                        compiler workflow targeting a number of physical and virtual quantum computing backends. qcor leverages novel Clang plugin interfaces and builds upon the <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/xacc">
                                            XACC</a> system-level quantum programming framework to provide a state-of-the-art integration mechanism for quantum-classical compilation that leverages the best from the community at-large. qcor translates
                                        quantum kernels ultimately to the XACC intermediate representation, and provides user-extensible hooks for quantum compilation routines like circuit optimization, analysis, and placement. This work details the overall
                                        architecture and compiler workflow for qcor, and provides a number of illuminating programming examples demonstrating its utility for near-term variational tasks, quantum algorithm expression, and feed-forward error
                                        correction schemes.</p>

                                        hardware platforms. It has 0 required external software dependencies besides C++11 standard, it optionally supports OpenCL accelerators back to the v1.1 standard, including multi-accelerator operation, and it prides
                                        itself on its "novel optimization layer." The speaker will outline the many features of the framework, including the theory behind the novel optimization layer, culminating in a simulator stack whose general use
                                        case is also its highest performance "Swiss Army knife" simulator, which has been integrated with a much wider developing quantum open source stack via plugins. Quantitative benchmarks will also be discussed, including
                                        performance on the quantum Fourier transform and an example of a "quantum volume"-type random universal circuit. Check out the project <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/Gj3CHDy">Discord</a> for more info!</p>
